Final tidy data set consists of 180 obs. and 81 variables

Every observation is an averaged variable for a unique combination of subject and activity

The column "subject" represents 30 observed people

The column "activity" represents 6 activities the "subjects" were doing while being observed, which are: 
1 WALKING
2 WALKING_UPSTAIRS
3 WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
4 SITTING
5 STANDING
6 LAYING

Other 79 columns represent measurements of mean (including meanFreq, as i consider it should be included in mean values substrat, 
as this variable represents mean frequency) and std, that are averaged by subject and activity, that is why there are 180 obs. (30*6)
